# DSA TRACKER

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-7000FF?style=for-the-badge) ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-ONLINE-00FF94?style=for-the-badge) ![Privacy](https://img.shields.io/badge/privacy-LOCAL_ONLY-00FFFF?style=for-the-badge)

## The Problem
Competitive programming is scattered. You solve distinct problems on **LeetCode**, arrays on **GeeksForGeeks**, and contests on **CodeForces**. 
- **Fragmented History**: You have no single view of what you solved and when.
- **Manual Tracking**: Maintaining an Excel sheet or Notion template is tedious and breaks your flow.
- **Lost Progress**: It's easy to forget a tough problem you solved 3 months ago without a revision system.

## The Solution
**DSA Tracker** is a browser extension that unifies your coding journey. It sits quietly in your browser, automatically detects when you're solving a problem, and lets you log it with one click. No context switching, no manual data entry.

## KEY FEATURES

### Unified Tracking
Works across major platforms. Whether you're on LeetCode, GeeksForGeeks, or CodeForces, the tracker adapts and scrapes the correct metadata (Title, Difficulty, Tags).

### Frictionless Logging
Don't type. The extension auto-fills:
- Problem Title
- Difficulty Level
- Related Tags (e.g., "Array", "DP", "Greedy")
- Problem Link

### Insightful Dashboard
Gain actual insights from your data:
- **Date-Grouped Feed**: See exactly what you solved on specific days.
- **Search & Filter**: Instantly find that one "Graph" problem you solved last month.
- **Heatmap & Streak**: Visual motivation to keep your consistency up.
- **Platform Analytics**: See where you spend the most time.

### Privacy Focused
We believe your data is yours.
- **Local Storage**: All data is stored in your browser's local sync storage.
- **No Servers**: We don't have a backend database. We don't see your data.
- **Exportable**: You can export your data to JSON at any time.
